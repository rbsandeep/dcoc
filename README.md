# dcoc
This program is used to prove that there are no deeply critical oriented cliques on 7 vertices.
For more details, please refer to the paper "On deeply critical oriented cliques" (Journal of Graph Theory)

Sample execution: python dcoc.py file-path

Input: A file containing graphs in g6 format.
Output: Lists of arcs of deeply critical oriented graphs among all possible orientations of edges of input graphs. 
Input (graphs of 7 vertices in g6 format) can be found at https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/graphs.html
